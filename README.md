## Introduction

SpotifyAPI is a REST API that helps developers to access Spotify data, such as song, album, artist, genre and playlist information. Developers can create, read, update and delete (CRUD). This API service also retrieves music data from [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/) allowing browsing and control of music playback for authenticated users.
